**When retouching a scanned image**

crop

check for dirt and scratches

don't use brightness/contrast for tone correction
    - brightness/contract is a linear tool 
    - levels and curves are non linear

a lot of cleaning up is usually done with the healing brush too

the next selection of tools to use would be the cloning tool

 

exercise one: use shadows and highlights

Kimo duplicated the images and put them into new layers

these adjustments are done directly to the image, NOT the layer

From the top menu bar-->

Image-->

Adjustments-->

Shadows/Highlights...

 

1. open the picture
2. crop any borders
3. check your histogram
4. cleanup any dirt and scratches
5. duplicate the original image and adjust the levels and increase the highlights

6. duplicate the original image and adjust the levels and increase the shadows

!Avoid Halos at all costs

is possible to adjust levels on a mask

Copy MERGED!!!!!

you can use the healing brush tool to blend texture. It is also wise to consider creating pickup layers to help with blending crunchy pixels.

create a tone adjustment layer on top

if you happen to need to make adjustments, such as cleaning up dirt, never go back and do it, add an adjustment layer on top.
