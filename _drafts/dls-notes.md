AJ Arabic Design Language
Creative Brief  -  v1.0
--- 

##Overview
Build AJ Arabic design language system as a centralized, living online resource. The system will consolidate design/brand guidelines and assets into an easily accessible location. It should define a clear lane for the AJ Arabic brand today and demonstrate a level of flexibility for the brand to evolve in the future.  

##Goal
The design language system will be a tool to drive design consistency for a cohesive brand experience in all channels. In turn, streamlining creative development and asset approval processes.  

##Creative Considerations
- Has any part of the AJ Arabic brand been defined?
- Are the current brand guidelines still relevant? 
- Has this been approved by stakeholders?
- Are people using the brand guidelines and are they currently effective?
- Does anything need to be updated or added? 
- Has any part of the AJ Arabic brand been designed? 
- Will these designs define the new design language & guidelines? 
- Who is writing & defining the design and brand guidelines?
- Are we leveraging the copy in the current brand guidelines?
- Is the AJ Arabic brand leveraging any parts of the overall AJ global brand? 

##Challenges
- Are all guidelines written?
- Are all technical design specs defined?
- Are all design demonstrations/examples created? (Digital, Print and On-Air)?

##Final Deliverables
- Install and configure CMS
- Custom Genesis theme for WordPress
- Custom post types
- Functionality to download assets

##Timing
- We need to break the work into groups of sprints leading up to launch.
- **Start date**: Sep 14
- **Delivery date**: Oct 31- 6.5 wks
- 1 week identify limitations, roles, responsibilities, plan content
- 1 week to design wireframes, mockups, and approved designs
- 2 weeks to build
- 1 week revision
- 1 week test and launch
- **Launch date**: AJA redesign. Nov 1 - 9 wks
- What can we do in parallel?
