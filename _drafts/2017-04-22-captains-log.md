These are some notes. Basically a brain dump

Work -  Custom Post Type
- Title
- Thumbnail Image
- Image description
- Client
- Skills
- Categories
- External URL
- Content

I need to figure out a better way to display information on my site

### To Dos:
- Make a list of all of the posts from the site

### Goals:
- Separate the work from the blog posts
