I've just deleted my Evernote account and now I'm downloading all of my files my server, which is taking forever. Once that's done I'm going to cancel my GoDaddy hosting. Why, might you ask? Evernote just came out at with a new policy that limits free accounts to only two devices. Which is fucking stupid. I can design / build my own solution. It won't not be as elegant and polished as Evernote but fuck it, I'll definitely learn a lot things in the process.

For a long while I've been interested in messing with Jekyll but never really made the time and effort to commit to it. It was low on my priorities list compared to improving my workflow and learning JavaScript. I'm going to use this 13 week challenge as the perfect opportunity to become a Jekyll and  WebStorm pro.

Oh yeah, I'm not paying for hosting anymore. I should act all fancy and say that I'm going completely open source but that's not really the case. Jekyll & Github seem to be a perfect solution for me. Handlebars engine is relatively simple templating engine and markdown makes crafting posts a breeze.

This is great. I just tested some js console logs and returned some successful messages. I'm feeling pretty optimistic about this journey. Looking forward to building and breaking a lot of shit within the next hundo days.
