## Extra Notes: 
Updating your Mac OX to El Capitan to v10.11.6 will cause compass command line function to not work properly.  
These two links were helpful to me:  
1. [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32891965/error-while-executing-gem-errnoeperm-operation-not-permitted](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32891965/error-while-executing-gem-errnoeperm-operation-not-permitted)  
2. Installing sass on OS X 10.11 (El Capitan) [https://github.com/sass/sass/issues/1768](https://github.com/sass/sass/issues/1768)

## Quick Notes Before I forget:
1. Install Acquia Dev Cloud app
2. Log into Dev Cloud through the app
3. Clone repo locally
4. Create new SSH key through app
5. Copy SSH key to clipboard
6. From your Acquia account add the copied SSH key to your credentials
7. Close Dev Cloud app and start the clone process over, this time the app should recognize the key and ask for the key password, then you should be good to go. 
8. Will make more sense of this later. Promise.
