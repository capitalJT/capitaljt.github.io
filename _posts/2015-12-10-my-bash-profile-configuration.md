Some Bash notes
- You can exit a mysql connection by typing the exit command.  

### Aliases
From video “Setting up Bash Aliases” - Drupalize.me  

- Aliases created in Terminal on a Mac are stored in .bash_profile
- Always remember to start a new session after creating a new alias
- good idea would be to create aliases for commonly misspelled commands (typos)
- another good idea would be to create shortcuts to certain directories

Here is a link to my bash configuration script. I try to frequently update it. Hopefully someone finds it to be useful.
