I ran into an error when I pulled the repo from git:  
`Dependency Error: Yikes! It looks like you don't have jekyll-gist or one of its dependencies installed. In order to use Jekyll as currently configured, you'll need to install this gem. The full error message from Ruby is: 'cannot load such file -- jekyll-gist' If you run into trouble, you can find helpful resources at http://jekyllrb.com/help/!`

Had to install `jekyll-gist` manually
