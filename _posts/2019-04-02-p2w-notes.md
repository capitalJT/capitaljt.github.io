# P2W notes

## This is a test

### From CB
These are the to-do items to ensure the promotion of the Plan 2 Win eBook/book launch goes smoothly. Velocity will be providing final content and creative, which we will pass to the Seer team to promote through LI and FB. 

The target audience is high-level: Finance leaders (VPâ€™s Finance, CFOs, etc.). 
- From a campaign distribution perspective, we will run these ads at lower level (Manager, Director) titles as well but the creative should be aimed at finance leaders. We cover a large range of company sizes (20-10,000 employees) so you get a lot of diversity in profiles, regardless of the title (a CFO at a 50 person company vs. a VP of FP&A at large enterprise)
- CTA: The CTA should drive people to get the book, but the link itself will point to the plan-2-win.com website
