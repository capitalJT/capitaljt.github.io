The other day at work Bob put me on to a book called The Self Journal. Its a 13-Week-Roadmap. He learned about it through his writing club. When he showed it to me I was impressed by the design and construction. It looked like a fancy Moleskine day planner with cliche quotes in nice typography. It had dot lines and a cool yellow cloth placeholder. I was sold. I'm a sucker for nice stationary. I have a collection of partially used Moleskines books that I like to look at. I never filling them out completely. Hopefully I can commit to this one. We'll see.
