So I really hate writing blog posts. I'm much better at writing code documentation. I've tried and dropped blogging about a thousand times already. I'm just insecure about sounding like a total jack-ass and I have this deep feeling that everything will be poorly written. I need to accept that I'm in a preliminary phase with writing and starting is the hardest part. Practice makes perfect and in order to improve I gotta look past this pussy-ass fear and get 'er done. Hopefully I'll be inspired to write frequently and after a while I can go back and delete these silly post. 

Let's see. Cheers!
